# OpenGL Avionics Simulation Engine (WIP)

This project is an **ongoing OpenGL tutorial and experimental engine** aimed at learning graphics programming while building the foundations of a lightweight simulation framework for **avionics systems**.

The focus isn’t on creating a full-fledged game engine, but rather on experimenting with the **graphics pipeline, input handling, and rendering techniques** to eventually simulate cockpit instruments, displays, and other avionics components.

## ✈️ Goals

* Learn and document **OpenGL fundamentals** step by step.
* Build a **simple rendering engine** with support for shaders, textures, and transformations.
* Simulate avionics systems such as:

  * Primary Flight Display (PFD)
  * Navigation Display (ND)
  * Engine instruments & indicators

---

## 🛠️ Features (Planned & In Progress)

* [x] OpenGL context setup (GLFW + GLAD)
* [x] Basic rendering pipeline (VAOs, VBOs, shaders)
* [x] Texture loading & mapping
* [x] 2D/3D transformations (matrices, camera)
* [ ] Modular rendering system for cockpit panels
* [ ] Real-time avionics simulations (flight data driving displays)

---

## 📚 Tech Stack

* **C++17**
* **OpenGL 4.x**
* **GLFW** (windowing & input)
* **GLAD** (OpenGL function loader)
* **glm** (math library)

## 📖 Learning Approach

This project doubles as a **tutorial log**. Each commit and module is documented to explain **why** something is implemented a certain way — not just the “how.”

Think of it as a **journey from drawing a triangle to simulating a flight display.**

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

* Implement basic avionics UI (artificial horizon, altimeter, airspeed indicator).
* Add input hooks for simulated sensor data.
* Expand to multi-panel rendering for complex avionics.
* Explore optimization techniques for real-time performance.
